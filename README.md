# Welcome to my Github Profile :raised_hands:!

<img src="./Banner/Profile.jpg" alt="banner-that-says-I'm-Sara-junior-software-engineer" width="900">

I'm a Junior Full-stack Software Developer and dedicated learner, recently completing CodeClan's flagship 16-week Software Development course and gaining an SQA Professional Development Award. 
I am currently actively job seeking and cannot wait to obtain my first job as a software developer!

I draw on over five years of professional experience in the healthcare sector and bring the management, coaching, quality improvement and soft skills I learned there to my new career in tech.
Some languages, frameworks and databases I enjoy working with include Javascript with React, Python with Flask, Java with Spring and a combination of both SQL and none SQL databases.
